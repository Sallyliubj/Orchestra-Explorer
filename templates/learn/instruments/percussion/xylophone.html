{% set technique = 'To play the xylophone, musicians strike the wooden bars with mallets made of plastic, rubber, or wood. Proper mallet selection, hand position, and striking technique are essential for producing clear, precise notes. Players can perform fast passages, arpeggios, and even chords using multiple mallets.' %}

It often doubles or highlights other parts, and its clear tone makes it effective in solo or featured passages. The xylophone is also used in contemporary music, film scores, and educational settings.' %}
