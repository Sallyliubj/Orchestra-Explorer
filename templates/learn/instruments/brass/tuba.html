{% set technique = 'The tuba is played by buzzing the lips into a large mouthpiece while pressing valves to change pitch. Due to its size, it requires significant breath support and careful control of air flow. Players must develop strong embouchure strength for the low register.' %}

{% set role = 'The tuba provides the bass foundation for brass and wind ensembles. In orchestras, it reinforces bass lines and adds depth to powerful passages. It can also serve as a solo instrument, demonstrating surprising agility despite its size.' %}

    'Some tubas can play notes so low they are felt more than heard'
