{% set description = 'The French horn is known for its warm, rich tone and distinctive coiled shape. It is one of the most versatile brass instruments, capable of both melodic and harmonic roles.' %}

{% set features = [
    'Made of about 12-13 feet of brass tubing coiled into a compact shape',
    'Uses a complex system of rotary valves',

    'Range spans about four octaves',
    'Can produce both bright and mellow tones'

{% set technique = 'The French horn is played by buzzing the lips into a mouthpiece while the right hand is positioned in the bell. The left hand operates the valves while the right hand can adjust the pitch and tone quality. Players must have excellent control of their embouchure and breath support.' %}

{% set role = 'The French horn serves multiple roles in the orchestra, from melodic solos to harmonic support. It can blend beautifully with both brass and woodwind sections, making it a versatile bridge between these families. Horn calls are often used to create heroic or hunting themes.' %}
