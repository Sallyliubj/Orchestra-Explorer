    'Made of wood (usually grenadilla) with a conical bore',
    'Double-reed instrument with complex key system',

{% set technique = 'The oboe is played by blowing through two thin pieces of cane (the double reed) while pressing keys to change notes. The player must maintain precise control of their embouchure and air pressure, as the small opening between the reeds requires high air pressure but minimal air flow. Various techniques include vibrato, articulation patterns, and special fingerings for trills and ornaments.' %}

{% set role = 'The oboe often carries important melodic lines in orchestral music, particularly in slow, expressive passages. It is frequently chosen for pastoral or melancholic themes. The oboe\'s penetrating tone makes it ideal for solos that need to project over the orchestra, and it traditionally gives the tuning A before performances.' %}

    'The oboe is a descendant of the shawm, a medieval double-reed instrument'
