{% set description = 'The cello is a versatile string instrument known for its rich, warm tone that closely resembles the human voice. It serves as a crucial bridge between the higher and lower voices in the orchestra.' %}

{% set features = [
    'Larger than the violin and viola, played in an upright position while seated',
    'Four strings tuned in perfect fifths: C2, G2, D3, and A3',
    'Played with a bow (arco) or by plucking the strings (pizzicato)',
    'Range spans about 4 octaves',
    'Rich, warm tone especially effective in melodic passages'
] %}

{% set technique = 'The cello is played while seated, with the instrument supported by an endpin resting on the floor. The bow is drawn across the strings while the left hand fingers press down on the strings to create different notes. Various techniques like vibrato, spiccato, and position shifts are used to create different musical effects.' %}

{% set role = 'The cello often carries the tenor voice in the orchestra, capable of both melodic and harmonic roles. It can provide a foundation for the harmony while also being equally capable of playing soaring melodies. In chamber music, the cello is essential in string quartets and other ensembles.' %}
