{% set description = 'The double bass is the largest and lowest-pitched string instrument in the modern symphony orchestra. Its deep, rich tone provides the foundation for both orchestral and jazz ensembles.' %}

{% set features = [
    'Largest string instrument in the orchestra, standing over 6 feet tall',
    'Four strings tuned in fourths: E1, A1, D2, and G2',
    'Played with a bow (arco) or by plucking (pizzicato)',
    'Range spans about three octaves',
    'Often features an extension to reach lower notes'

{% set technique = 'The double bass is played standing or sitting on a high stool, with the instrument supported by an endpin. The bow is drawn across the strings while the left hand presses the strings against the fingerboard. Due to its size, the double bass requires significant physical strength and uses different fingering patterns than other string instruments.' %}

{% set role = 'The double bass provides the harmonic foundation in the orchestra, often doubling the cellos an octave lower. It is essential in both classical and jazz music, where its deep resonance and rhythmic capabilities are fully utilized. In chamber music, it adds depth and richness to the ensemble sound.' %}
