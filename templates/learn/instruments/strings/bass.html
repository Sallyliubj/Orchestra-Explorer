{% set description = 'The double bass is the largest and lowest-pitched bowed string instrument in the modern symphony orchestra. Its deep, rich sound provides the foundation for both classical and jazz music.' %}

{% set features = [
    'Massive size requires standing or sitting on a high stool to play',
    'Usually tuned in fourths: E1, A1, D2, and G2',
    'Can be played with a bow (arco) or by plucking (pizzicato)',
    'Range spans about 3 octaves',
    'Unique sloping shoulders and flat back distinguish it from other string instruments'
] %}

{% set technique = 'The double bass can be played either standing up or sitting on a high stool. Due to its large size, the strings are much thicker and require more force to press down. The bow (German or French style) is drawn across the strings, or the strings can be plucked for a more percussive sound, especially common in jazz.' %}

{% set role = 'The double bass provides the harmonic foundation in the orchestra, often doubling the cellos an octave lower. It is essential in both classical and jazz music, where its deep resonance helps establish the rhythmic and harmonic base. In jazz, it often plays a walking bass line that outlines the harmony.' %}

{% set fun_facts = [
    'The double bass is sometimes called the "upright bass" or "string bass"',
    'It is the only modern bowed string instrument tuned in fourths rather than fifths',
    'The double bass evolved from the viola da gamba family rather than the violin family',
    'Jazz bassists often prefer to pluck the strings rather than use a bow'
