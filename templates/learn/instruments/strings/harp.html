{% set description = 'The harp is a beautiful and ancient string instrument that produces ethereal, shimmering sounds. Its distinctive triangular shape and elegant appearance make it one of the most visually striking instruments in the orchestra.' %}

{% set features = [
    'Modern concert harps typically have 47 strings and 7 pedals',
    'Strings are color-coded (red C strings, black F strings) to help orientation',
    'Pedal mechanism allows for quick key changes and chromatic playing',
    'Range spans about 6½ octaves',
    'Strings are plucked with the fingertips to create crystalline tones'
] %}

{% set technique = 'The harp is played by plucking the strings with the fingertips while seated. The right hand typically plays higher notes and the left hand lower notes. Seven pedals at the base of the instrument can each be set to three positions, allowing the player to change the pitch of all strings of the same note name. Various techniques like glissandos, harmonics, and près de la table (playing near the soundboard) create different tonal effects.' %}

{% set role = 'The harp adds a magical, ethereal quality to orchestral music. It can provide sparkling arpeggios, dramatic glissandos, or delicate accompaniment. While it often plays a decorative role, the harp can also carry melodic lines and is frequently featured in cadenzas. In chamber music and as a solo instrument, the harp\'s full range of colors and textures can be explored.' %}
